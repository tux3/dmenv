# Usage

## Setup

First, `dmenv` needs a Python3 interpreter in PATH, which should be called `python` or `python3`. This should already be the case if you've just installed Python3, regardless of your operating system.

Second, `dmenv` needs a `setup.py` file to work.

* If you don't have a `setup.py` yet, you can run `dmenv init <project name>`
  to generate one. In this case, make sure to read the comments inside
  and edit it to fit your needs.

* If you already have one, please note that `dmenv` uses the `extras_require` keyword with a `dev` key
  to specify development dependencies, which you can use to replace your `dev-requirements.txt`
  file for instance.

And that's it. Now you are ready to use `dmenv`!

Here's a description of the main commands:


## dmenv lock

Here's what `dmenv lock` does:

* First, it creates a virtualenv for you with `python -m venv` in
  `.venv/<version>`, where `<version>` is read from `python --version`. Make
  sure to add `.venv` to your `.gitignore`! Note that this step is skipped
  if `dmenv` detects it is run from an existing virtualenv.

* Then it runs `pip intall --editable .[dev]` so that your dev deps are installed, and the scripts listed in `entry_points` are
  created.

* Finally, it runs `pip freeze` to generate a `requirements.lock` file.

Now you can add the `requirements.lock` file to your version control system.

This leads us to the next command.

## dmenv install

Now that the complete list of dependencies and their versions is written in the
`requirements.lock` file, anyone can run `dmenv install` to install all the
dependencies and get exactly the same versions you got when you ran `dmenv lock`.

Hooray reproducible builds!

## dmenv run

As a convenience, you can use:`dmenv run` to run any binary from the virtualenv. If the program you want to run
needs command-line options, use a `--` to separated them from `dmenv` options, like so:

```console
dmenv run -- pytest --collect-only
```

## dmenv upgrade-pip

Tired of `pip` telling you to upgrade itself? Run `dmenv upgrade-pip` :)

It's exactly the same as typing `dmenv run -- python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, but with less keystrokes :P


## dmenv show:venv_path

Useful to activate the virtualenv for your current shell. For instance:

```bash
source "$(dmenv show:venv_path)/bin/activate"
```

## dmenv show:deps

Just a wrapper for `pip list`:

```bash
$ dmenv show:deps
Package            Version
------------------ -------
atomicwrites       1.2.1
attrs              18.2.0
importlib-metadata 0.6
...
```
