## What it does

`dmenv` takes care of:

* Creating a virtualenvs for you: one virtualenv per project and Python version, thus
  enforcing some commonly agreed-upon best practices

* Generating a *lock file* that contains *all the versions* of all your dependencies at
  a given time, so you can have reproducible builds

If does it by:

* reading information about your project in the `setup.py` file and nothing else
* using already existing tools such as `python3 -m venv` and `pip`

As the tag line implies, its implementation is as simple as possible and it contains the
*bare minimum* amount of features.
