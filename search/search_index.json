This should already be the case if you've just installed Python3, regardless of your operating system. Second, dmenv needs a setup.py file to work. If you don't have a setup.py yet, you can run dmenv init <project name> to generate one. In this case, make sure to read the comments inside and edit it to fit your needs. If you already have one, please note that dmenv uses the extras_require keyword with a dev key to specify development dependencies, which you can use to replace your dev-requirements.txt file for instance. And that's it. Now you are ready to use dmenv ! Here's a description of the main commands: dmenv lock \u00b6 Here's what dmenv lock does: First, it creates a virtualenv for you with python -m venv in .venv/<version> , where <version> is read from python --version . Make sure to add .venv to your .gitignore ! Note that this step is skipped if dmenv detects it is run from an existing virtualenv. Then it runs pip intall --editable .[dev] so that your dev deps are installed, and the scripts listed in entry_points are created. Finally, it runs pip freeze to generate a requirements.lock file. Now you can add the requirements.lock file to your version control system. This leads us to the next command. dmenv install \u00b6 Now that the complete list of dependencies and their versions is written in the requirements.lock file, anyone can run dmenv install to install all the dependencies and get exactly the same versions you got when you ran dmenv lock . Hooray reproducible builds! dmenv run \u00b6 As a convenience, you can use: dmenv run to run any binary from the virtualenv. If the program you want to run needs command-line options, use a -- to separated them from dmenv options, like so: dmenv run -- pytest --collect-only dmenv upgrade-pip \u00b6 Tired of pip telling you to upgrade itself? Run dmenv upgrade-pip :) It's exactly the same as typing dmenv run -- python -m pip install --upgrade pip , but with less keystrokes :P dmenv show:venv_path \u00b6 Useful to activate the virtualenv for your current shell. For instance: source \"$(dmenv show:venv_path)/bin/activate\" dmenv show:deps \u00b6 Just a wrapper for pip list : $ dmenv show:deps Package Version ------------------ ------- atomicwrites 1.2.1 attrs 18.2.0 importlib-metadata 0.6 ...","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#setup","text":"First, dmenv needs a Python3 interpreter in PATH, which should be called python or python3 .
